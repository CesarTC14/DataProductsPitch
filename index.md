## Motivation

* If you have ever started to study statistics, you are probably familiar with some probability distributions.

* I could bet I know exactly the image that comes to your mind when I mention a **Normal Distribution**.


* That's because probability distributions associated with variables and events have very famous graphic representations.


* But life isn't about single variables, is it?

## Here's a very familiar plot

## Here's another very familiar plot

## The Pitch

* Do you know what the interaction of two variables with those famous distributions would look like?

* Did you ever wonder how that interaction would change with different sets of means, standard deviations and degrees of freedom?

* Than here's the app for you!
